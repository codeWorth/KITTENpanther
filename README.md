# KITTENpanther

This is a group of programmers in a high school robotics club

We make stuff. Actually codeWorth makes stuff. Cause LEGIONOF7 DOESN'T DO ANYTHING :P And the other person doesn't even have a github. LoL

Projects made:
1. Task Manager: allows a user to input and remove tasks that give an alert (!! DUE !!) when due or late.
